## Platform Randomizer TBD

This is a mod aimed at adding more variety to each playthrough by adding additional randomness to the lifespan/performance of platforms, with the primary goal of incentivizing different game/platform choices on each run without compromising normal gameplay

Randomization is applied when making a new save based on the current values set for the mod in its settings tab

    - Default range is 0.75 - 1.25 of the normal lifespan
  - Audience Weights
  - Genre Weights

  - Platform License costs
- Random Platform lifetime Events
  - Each segment of the lifespan of a platform has a small chance for one of the following events to occur
